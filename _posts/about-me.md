## I love birds!

That's why all my blog posts have birds. All pictures where taken by me. Click on the pics if you wanna learn more about the birds.

## Why did I start a blog?

I've decided I would try the learn in public approach. So many times before I found myself frustrated because I couldn't find the resources to solve my coding problems. So this blog is my go at making content the way I wish it would be done. Short and concise.

## A little bit of history

I'm 31 year's old, I live in Paraguay, and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. I started learning how to code at the end of 2019. I knew I was about to have a lot of free time, and learning how to code is something that I always had on the back of mi mind. I love knowing that there is always something to learn, and it's as easy as googling it.

But that's just the most recent chapter of my life, before that, during about 11 years, I was fully immersed in the music world. I owned a rental company, and I worked as a freelance _audio-guy_. I was fortunate enough to work at the biggest festivals and met a lot of wonderful people along the way.

If I had to choose I would do it all again, but i'm grateful I get another chance to learn a different profession and to meet people from all around the world.

## That's it!

If you're still reading you definitely have a lot of free time. I love talking about code and such, hit me up on any of my social media if you want.
