## I love nature!

I realized that you don't need to be an environmental engineed to make an impact and help with conservation, you can see this in the work I'm putting on as volunteer in environmental non-profits and also the contracts I chose to take as a freelance developer. I also love birding! All pictures you see in this webpage where taken by me. Click on the pics if you wanna learn more about the birds.

## A little bit of history

I'm Paraguayan and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. I started learning how to code at the end of 2019. I knew I was about to have a lot of free time, and learning how to code is something that I always had on the back of mi mind. I had and still have amazing mentors that really accelerated my career.

But that's just the most recent chapter of my life, before that, I was fully immersed in the music world. I owned a rental company, and I worked as a freelance _audio-guy_. I was fortunate enough to work at the biggest festivals and met a lot of wonderful people along the way.

It's amazing how much overlap I find between both careers, specially with soft skills. Coding is a lot about working together with other people and understanding what customers need.

If I had to choose I would do it all again, but i'm grateful I get another chance to learn a different profession and to meet people from all around the world.

## That's it!
